# Licence and warranty

AceMQ for RabbitMQ administration is
[Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). You may use it
in production, commercially, without asking and without paying.

## No warranty

The libraries are provided **"as is", without warranties or conditions of any
kind**, and the authors and contributors accept no liability for damages arising
from their use.

That is not a notice added here for comfort — it is
[section 7](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#no-warranty) and
[section 8](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#no-liability) of the
licence, and it is the same footing as every other Apache-licensed dependency
already running in your systems.

Practically, it means the same thing it means for any open-source library you
depend on: **test it against your workload before you rely on it.** The
integration suite runs against a real RabbitMQ 4.x broker in a container, and
what it covers is stated plainly in the documentation — including the parts of
the management API that are not wrapped yet.

This library writes to a broker: it creates and deletes vhosts, users,
permissions and policies. `deleteVhost` destroys every queue and message in a
vhost with no confirmation and no undo. Point it at a test broker until you are
sure of what your code does.

## If you need more than a licence gives you

Warranties, indemnity, response times and someone accountable come from a
contract, not from a licence. That is what
[AceMQ Enterprise support](https://acemq.com) is for: architecture review,
production readiness, TLS and permission design, and incident response.

The libraries are complete and free to use without it, and are not crippled to
sell it.

## Trademarks

The licence grants no trademark rights
([section 6](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#trademarks)).

**RabbitMQ is a trademark of Broadcom Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.** AceMQ is an
independent project, is not affiliated with, endorsed by or sponsored by
Broadcom, and references to RabbitMQ describe compatibility only.

This library targets RabbitMQ's HTTP management API specifically. That API is
RabbitMQ's own and is not a standard; naming it describes what this code talks
to, and claims nothing more.

Prometheus is a trademark of The Linux Foundation.

## Contributions

Contributions are accepted under the same licence, per
[section 5](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0#contributions): anything
you deliberately submit for inclusion is licensed to the project under Apache-2.0
unless you state otherwise.
